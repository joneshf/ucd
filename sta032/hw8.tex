              I am convinced the mean number of sick days is less than 5.4 after allowing telecommuting.
              The probability that the sample was from a population where the mean number of sick days was greater than 5.4 is exceedingly small.
              It is much more likely that the sample was taken from a population with a mean number of sick days less than 5.4.

              I am convinced that the laser is properly calibrated.
              Since the probability that the sample was from a population with 0 mean error is effectively 1,
              it makes sense that the laser is properly calibrated.

              The null hypothesis should be:
              \[
                H_0: \mu \le 8 \textrm{ years}
              \]
              If $H_0$ is rejected,
              then it is known that the batteries will have a mean lifetime of more than 8 years and
              so can be installed in pacemakers.

              If $H_0$ is not rejected,
              then the batteries might have a mean lifetime less than 8 years and
              so cannot be installed in pacemakers.
            \item
              The null hypothesis should be:
              \[
                H_0: \mu \le \num{60000} \textrm{ miles}
              \]
              If $H_0$ is rejected,
              then it is known that the tires will have a mean lifetime more than \num{60000} miles and
              so the new material can be used to make tires.

              If $H_0$ is not rejected,
              then the tires might have a mean lifetime less than \num{60000} miles and
              so the new material cannot be used to make tires.
            \item
              The null hypothesis should be:
              \[
                H_0: \mu = \num{10} \textrm{ \si{\milli\liter\per\second}}
              \]
              If $H_0$ is rejected,
              then it is known that the flow rate will be \num{10} \si{\milli\liter\per\second} and
              so the flowmeter should be recalibrated.

              If $H_0$ is not rejected,
              then the flow rate might not be \num{10} \si{\milli\liter\per\second} and
              so the flowmeter should not be recalibrated.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item [14]
          i. Greater than 0.05.

          We can compute the necessary values from the information given.

          With the interval from 1.2 to 2.0,
          we can compute $\overline{X} = \frac{1.2 + 2.0}{2} = 1.6$.

          We also know that
          \begin{align*}
            1.2 &= 1.6 - 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \\
            1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} &= 0.4 \\
            \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} &= \frac{0.4}{1.96} \\
            \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} &= \num{0.20408163265306123} \\
          \end{align*}

          So, we can compute a z-score
          \[
            Z = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1.6 - 1.4}{\num{0.20408163265306123}} = 0.98
          \]

          The corresponding p-value is 0.8365, which much greater than 0.05.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item [$\S$ 6.3]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item [7]
          We want the hypotheses:

          \begin{align*}
            H_0 &: \mu \le 0.7 \\
            H_A &: \mu > 0.7 \\
          \end{align*}

          So $n = 150$ and $p = 0.7$.

          Thus, $\hat{p} \sim N\left(150, \frac{0.7 (1 - 0.7)}{150}\right) = N(150, \num{0.00140})$.

          This lets us compute $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\num{0.00140}} = \num{0.0374}$,
          and an observed $\hat{p} = \frac{110}{150} = \num{0.7333333}$.

          So we have a z-score of $Z = \frac{\num{0.7333} - 0.7}{\num{0.0374}} = 0.8913$.

          The corresponding p-value is $1 - 0.8133 = 0.1867$.

          Since this value is much higher than 0.05,
          we do not reject the null hypothesis.
          We cannot conclude that more than 70\% of the households in the city have high-speed internet access.
        \item [8]
          We want the hypotheses:

          \begin{align*}
            H_0 &: \mu \ge 0.08 \\
            H_A &: \mu < 0.08 \\
          \end{align*}

          So $n = 300$ and $p = 0.08$.

          Thus, $\hat{p} \sim N\left(300, \frac{0.08 (1 - 0.08)}{300}\right) = N(300, \num{0.0002453})$.

          This lets us compute $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\num{0.0002453}} = \num{0.015663}$,
          and an observed $\hat{p} = \frac{12}{300} = \num{0.04}$.

          So we have a z-score of $Z = \frac{\num{0.04} - 0.08}{\num{0.015663}} = \num{-2.553789184702803}$.

          The corresponding p-value is $0.0054$.

          Since this value is very small, we reject the null hypothesis.
          We can conclude that less than 8\% of the produced parts are defective.

            Since the p-value is less than 0.050, we reject the null hypothesis.

          \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item See part i above.
            \item See part iii above.
            \item
              Since we reject the null hypothesis,
              the alternative hypothesis states that the mean flow rate is more than 5 gpm.

              So, the pumps should be put into service.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item [4]
          \hypott{10}{23.2}{0.2}{23}{=}{\ne}{$0.01 < P < 0.005$}{
            Since the p-value is less than 0.050, we reject the null hypothesis.
          }
          \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item See part i above.
            \item See part iii above.
            \item
              Since we reject the null hypothesis,
              the alternative hypothesis states that the mean percentage of potassium by weight is not 23\%.

              So, the process should be recalibrated.
          \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item [$\S$ 6.5]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item [7]
          \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item
              \hypotztwo{80}{7.79}{1.06}{80}{7.64}{1.31}{\le}{0.2119}{\pnotsmall}

              From the above,
              we cannot conclude that the mean score on one-tailed hypothesis test questions is higher than the mean score on two-tailed hypothesis test questions.
            \item
              \hypotztwo{80}{7.79}{1.06}{80}{7.64}{1.31}{=}{0.4238}{\pnotsmall}

              From the above,
              we cannot conclude that the mean score on one-tailed hypothesis test questions differs from the mean score on two-tailed hypothesis test questions.
          \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
    \item [$\S$ 6.6]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item [12]
          \hypotztwoprop{546}{87}{508}{74}{=}{0.5871}{\pnotsmall}

          From the above, we do not reject the null hypothesis.
          So we cannot conclude that the proportion of boys who are overweight differs from the proportion of girls who are overweight.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item [$\S$ 6.7]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item [13]
          \hypotttwo{12}{27.3}{5.2}{14}{32.7}{4.1}{\ge}{$0.001 < P < 0.005$}{\psmall}

          From the above, we reject the null hypothesis.
          So we conclude that the mean time to sleep is less for the new drug than the old drug.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item [$\S$ 6.12]
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item [4]
          \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item
              Since $\mu$ satisfies $H_0$, $H_0$ should not be rejected.
              This is a type I error.
            \item
              Since $\mu$ satisfies $H_0$, $H_0$ should not be rejected.
              The decision is correct.
            \item
              Since $\mu$ does not satisfy $H_0$, $H_0$ should be rejected.
              This is a type II error.

              Since $\mu$ does not satisfy $H_0$, $H_0$ should be rejected.
              The decision is correct.
          \end{enumerate}
        \item [5]
          \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
            \item
              Since the claim is true, $H_0$ should not be rejected.
              This is a type I error.
