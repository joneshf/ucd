Introduction 
Cooperation among unrelated individuals has widely been explained by evolutionary approaches that focus on altruism, altruistic punishment and kin selection, while other explanations have focused on the interaction between cultural and genetic transmission, such as pro-social and anti-social behavior, and social learning heuristics (Mathew and Boyd 2011; Fehr and GÃ¤chter 2002; Henrich 2004). Others have focused on institutions for collective-action, the decision-making devices that individuals create and/or join to facilitate and manage a common pool resource (Ostrom 1990). Collective-action problems describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action (i.e., managing common pool resources), but has an associated cost making it implausible that any one individual can or will undertake and solve it alone. Other problems that arise include: free-riding (i.e., someone who benefits from goods without paying the cost of the benefit), solving commitment problems, arranging for the supply of new institutions and monitoring individual compliance with sets of rules (Ostrom 1990). Institutions are created with the aim of governing the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community by mediating the rules that govern decision-making. Given the fact, how effective are institutions with scale of community? Moreover, how do institutions facilitate the conflict-mediation process in transient communities? This research investigates whether the role of institutions for collective-actions are affected by resident turnover in cooperative (co-op) housing units in Davis, California. Specifically, this research focuses on the relationship between the transient nature of the co-ops and the institution that governs conflict mediation.
