<H1>Project 1: Connect Four</H1>
<H3 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER> 
</H3>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="intro_sec"></A>Introduction</H2>
<P>In this assignment, you'll write a computer program to play the
classic game Connect Four. This is a great way to practice the
minimax and heuristic algorithms we've covered in class.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="rules_sec"></A>How to Play</H2>
<P>Connect Four is a tic-tac-toe variant played on a grid. Players
alternate turns dropping coins into one of the seven different
columns. Unlike tic-tac-toe, Connect Four worlds are affected by
gravity and you may only place coins at the lowest possible positions
in each column. In other words, moves in Connect Four are made by
dropping the coins into the columns, rather than placing them into
specific squares.</P>
<P>As the name implies, the goal of Connect Four is to get four of
your colored coins in a row, either horizontally, diagonally, or
vertically. The first player to do so wins. If all&nbsp;locations are
filled without a player getting four in a row, the game is a draw.</P>
<P>Connect Four is known to be biased in favor of the first player,
so when testing your AI make sure that you have it play as both the
first and second player. A decent AI program will never lose as the
first player, and a good AI program will be able to win going second.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="instruct_sec"></A>Instructions</H2>
<P>We've provided you with a good amount of starter code to handle
most of the complicated setup. The provided starter code is a working
Connect Four engine that allows you to mix and match human and
computer opponents using the command line. Your assignment is to
create an instance of the <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_a_i_module.html">AIModule</A>
class that plays Connect Four. To do so, you'll need to familiarize
yourself with the workings of the <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_game_state.html">GameState</A>
and <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_a_i_module.html">AIModule</A>
classes.</P>
<P>Because even a simple minimax player can play perfectly given
unlimited time, in this assignment part of your task will be to
create a player that can work in limited time conditions. During game
play, your player will have to select a move within a given time
frame. <B>Make sure you understand what the chosenMove field of the

class is for before writing your player. Take a look at </B><A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_monte_carlo_a_i.html"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">MonteCarloAI</SPAN></A><B>
for an example of how to write a working AI.</B></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="code_sec"></A>The Provided Framework</H2>
<P>The starter code we've provided will work out of the box and
should require no changes on your part. As with the previous
assignment, if you want to make any changes to our code, please let
us know in advance.</P>
<P>The Connect Four program has several different command-line
switches that you can use to control how the game is played. By
default, the two players are human-controlled. You can choose which
AI modules to use by using the -p1 and -p2 switches to select the
AIModules to use as the first and second player. For example, to pit
the <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_random_a_i.html">RandomAI</A>
player against the <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_monte_carlo_a_i.html">MonteCarloAI</A>
player, you could use:</P>
<P>java <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_main.html">Main</A>
-p1 <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_random_a_i.html">RandomAI</A>
-p2 <A HREF="/../../../../../../../davidson/Teaching/2009-ECS170/Assign2/Code%252520To%252520Distribute/html/class_monte_carlo_a_i.html">MonteCarloAI</A></P>
<P>Any unspecified players will be filled in with human players.</P>
<P>You can also customize how much time is available to the AI
players. By default, each computer has 500ms to think. You can use
the -t switch to change this. Use the --help switch to learn more
about the options available to you.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all of these questions you will be
playing connect-4 on a 7x6 board. Please form groups of three or four
